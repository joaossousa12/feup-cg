# CG 2023/2024

## Group T06G09

## TP 2 Notes

- In the first exercise we did the tangram atributed to our group, we worked with the figures from last tp overriding the display method on MyTangram and we applied translations, rotations and scalings to the figures in order to make the tangram. We also started using colors for each figure of the tangram. Overall we had no difficulties.
